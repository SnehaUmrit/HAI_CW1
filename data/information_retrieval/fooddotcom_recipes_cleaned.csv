i do not used canned beans because of the sodium.  but if you use a pressure cooker, a whole bag of dry beans (not soaked) only takes 35-40 minutes to cook.

once upon a time,,, there were two unemployed and very poor men who decided to become beggars so they shouldn't starve to death. 'well', they thought,'this will be easy'.  they were turned down at every door and tavern and were shooed out of town.  'eureka!  i have an idea' said one fellow and he proceeded to fill his pot with water from the nearby river.  he asked his companion to find a large rock and to scrub it on the rivers edge.  the companion did just so and brought it to his friend just as the townspeople were drawing water from the river.  the friend put the stone into the boiling water.  'hey there, you two, just what are you cooking""?  the fellow shouted across the river. ""why it's just stone soup! please my friend, have a taste.""  so the new friend waded through the water and dipped his spoon into the stone soup.  ''gracious me, this is the best stone soup i have ever tasted!  but you know, i have some onions and some beans in my kitchen that would make your stone soup taste spectacular.  would you mind?"" ' why no kind sir if you think it would help my meager soup'.  soon the laundress came over with an apron full of potatoes.  'excuse me sir but if you are going to put his onions into your stone soup you surely would want my new potatoes to sweeten the taste.""  ''well yes, we would...''  one by one the villagers dropped in their offers, a pheasant plucked clean, celery and radishes, rutabagas and turnips and even a haunch of beef.  finally after adding a bottle of fine wine the pot was filled to the top.  ""patience dear villagers. as you all know stone soup cannot be rushed, it must simmer the full two hours''. while they waited some went home for honey cakes and loaves of bread and some went for cheese and fruit and even tables and chairs.  soon the hour arrived and the villagers dined on stone soup to their hearts content.  no one could recall ever eating such delicious stone soup.  as dark fell upon them they asked the beggar-men if they would serve stone soup again next midday.  no, they lamented, they would be making coin soup and they would love to invite the villagers to dine.  hu-rah!  they would bring coins, meat, fowl and cockles and perhaps bread for the coin soup and went home sated and content that they would dine better the next day.","['water', 'beans', 'pheasant', 'beef', 'onion', 'celery', 'new potato', 'rutabagas', 'turnips', 'wine', 'salt and pepper', 'herbs', 'spices']",13,2421.5,115.0,103.0,56.0,375.0,109.0,19.0

updated march 29, 2010; in response to criticism: use care...you must blend completely or it will not cook to a proper texture!

i personally like the soft, delicate flavor the recipe produces as is....

if you prefer a more complex variation:  
increase vanilla bean and/or extract or add additional flavors if desired by adding to recipe as is if you prefer stronger flavor.  

to maintain a delicate, gourmet flavor, try substituting another extract or liquid flavoring for the vanilla extract and/or adding a dash of spices.

some ideas: 
orange extract + cloves; 
rum extract + cinnamon; 
vanilla extract + chocolate chips; 
peppermint extract + chocolate syrup/shavings/chips; 
orange extract + chocolate syrup/shavings/chips; 
rum extract + cinnamon, cloves, and/or ginger;

i have found that you need to follow the directions *exactly* to get the best cookies. not using real butter or all brown sugar, not beating the eggs in one at a time, not baking them at a higher temp than the ""traditional"" recipe, all make a difference in the end result. 

i have also found that land o' lake butter makes a better cookie than some generic brand butter. don't let the butter sit out too long. it needs to soften but if it sits until the moisture starts to separate from the butter, it is too soft and it will affect the resulting cookies. if that happens, refrigerate the dough for about an hour to help them not spread as much. it also helps to use the mixer on the dough in between batches going into the oven. it helps keep the dough from starting to separate if it is a warm day. 

another thing i've learned is you have to make sure there is plenty of circulation in your oven. when i moved, my cookies started turning out flat again. i finally realized that my oven was smaller at the new house and when i switched to smaller cookie sheets, my cookies turned out perfectly!","['all-purpose flour', 'baking soda', 'salt', 'real butter', 'shortening', 'brown sugar', 'vanilla', 'eggs', 'semi-sweet chocolate chips', 'nuts']",10,164.3,13.0,56.0,4.0,3.0,20.0,7.0

here are some of my favorites and you can really do what you like.  dried vs fresh herbs are best, not too many ""wet"" ingredients; such as olives, onions, sundried tomatoes, etc., and if you add cheese, no more than 1 cup.

- chile beer at any specialty liquor store, monterey jack cheese and cilantro

- pumpkin beer, yes in the fall, pecans, rosemary, and swiss cheese

- any good dark like amberbock, apples, dried cranberries and gruyere

- honey wheat, caramelized onion, cheddar, and thyme

- light beer, green chilies, jalapeno jack and cilantro

- red berry or any berry beer, walnuts and provolone with cinnimon

- any dark beer, raisins, cranberries, cinnimon and brown sugar vs white

- bock beer, sundried tomatoes, olives and oregano

- maple or pumpkin beer, cinnimon, raisins, pecans and dried apples

i have used bacon bits and cheddar;  all herbs;  or just cheese.  endless combinations.  but this is a favorite for breakfast or even a late night snack with cream cheese.

many of these are available year round at most larger liquor stores any many of the beers are available during seasons, like the pumpkin and maple available during the fall and winter months.  a hearth bock for some brewers is available in winter and it is good with mediterranean flavors.

now this is the basic recipe ...
12 oz beer (i use a standard bottle with is 12 oz)
3 cups flour self rising, sifted (sifted is important), if not using self rising, use all purpose, but add 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
(flavorings)

the trick is to use raw cashews. they have no flavor of their own, they are just a vessel for fat and creaminess. because it has a nice fat content, cashew cream reduces in a pan even faster than heavy cream. cashews need to soak overnight, so don't skip this step. this is from the conscious cook by tal ronnen.  chef tal was a former meat eater that  now applies traditional french culinary techniques to meatless cuisine. he shows that avoiding meat and dairy does not mean sacrificing taste or satisfaction. enjoy!","['raw cashews', 'cold water']",2,629.1,78.0,21.0,0.0,33.0,50.0,11.0
