# BERRY, THE FOOD BOT
This file provides the instructions required to run the implemented chatbot along with a brief overview of the different components of the implemented codes.

## Running the chatbot

**Pre-requisite: Python**

In order to run the chatbot, the following steps can be followed:
1. Open command prompt and change the directory to the folder containing **chatbot.py**.
```
> cd "C:\User\...\20211968_CW1_Codes"
```
2. Run using chatbot.py
```
C:\User\AdminName\...\20211968_CW1_Codes>chatbot.py 
```

## Using the bot

The main functionalities of the bot include small talk, food recommendation, item tracking, information retrieval and identity management. These features can be used interchangeably.
